# Code for "Maximizing Submodular Functions for Recommendation in the Presence of Biases"
This repository contains the code for reproducing the simulations in our paper.

## Running simulations
1. Run `setup.sh` to download the MovieLens dataset and create the required directory structure
2. To reproduce the simulations run `synthetic-data/run-simulation.ipynb` and `real-world-data/run-simulation.ipynb`
